python string_processing_pipeline.py
```

## Expected output:

```bash
$ python string_processing_pipeline.py
Printer got line: hi hi for the 1:TH TIME...
Printer got line: hi hi for the 2:TH TIME...
Printer got line: hi hi for the 3:TH TIME...

Kudos to [Simone Baffelli](https://github.com/baffelli)'s
[Pyperator](https://github.com/baffelli/pyperator/) library which showed that
it is in fact possible to implement an FBP-like library using asyncio.
